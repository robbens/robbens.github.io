This is crazy. It's now been two days since I converted my notes into Sans Forgetica.Â I won't be doing any research or numbers here. But I'll tell y'all this: it helped me remember more!

Wtf. What is Sans Forgetica?
It's a font where they've removed certain parts of the letters, so that the brain works harder and more engaging with processing the words. Sooo cool!

Check it out!

Just for fun. I switched my font in PhpStorm to try it out. Not sure I'll be keeping it for long ðŸ˜„
