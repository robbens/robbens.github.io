title: Cloudflare actually slows your website down

So I've almost always used Cloudflare for my personal websites. Recently I started asking my self why? Is it better than just a DNS?

I don't need the security, DDOS protection, caching, auto minify or Rocket Loader. And I don't care that you can see my servers IP address.

## Time to speed test
Pingdom Tools and Gtmetrix are probably the best free speed test services out there.

Not sure why Pingdom's screenshot is not working. Nevertheless â€“ I was chocked by the speed difference.

### With Cloudflare

### Without Cloudflare
![Pingdom Tools speed test without Cloudflare](/assets/images/cloudflare-speed/pingdom-without-cloudflare.png)
**31.7% faster**  

![GTmetrix speed test without Cloudflare](/assets/images/cloudflare-speed/gtmetrix-without-cloudflare.png)
**47.6% faster!**  

## Conclusion
You probably don't need Cloudflare. Just use a solid DNS provider along with a CDN and you'll be golden.
