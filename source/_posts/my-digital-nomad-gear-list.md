The new normal is boosting the number of remote workers, and it is here to stay! ü•≥  
If you are a traveling remote worker, you'll want to consider using one carry-on size backpack for all of your stuff. They are usually up to around 40L depending on the airline. 

### Now, why would you want only one small-ish bag?

* It's cheap! The price of airplane tickets are considerably less without checked luggage.
* Never worry about lost checked bags. You have everything above your head.
* Saves time in the airport. Go straight to security and skip the baggage claim!
* It will force you to only bring things that you will actually use.
* Easy and cheap transport. No problem getting on that $2 scooter.
* You won't look like the typical tourist.

## My packing list
### Tech
* **Macbook Air M1**  
This is an absolute beast. Light and cheap with the performance of a last gen Macbook Pro 15" ü§§

* **HyperJuice 100W GaN charger**  
Another beast. Charges all my devices without a sweat.

* **DJI Mini 2**  
I only travel with the actual drone and controller to save space.

* **GoPro Hero 8 Black**  
With the magnetic swivel clip and a strap.

* **Anker USB-C to Lightning**  
Been using this for almost two years now. Still looks brand new!

* **JBL GO 3**  
Small speaker with good sound and *USB-C port* for charging.

* **AirPods Pro**  
I previously used the infamous Bose QC 35 II and the AirPods has won me over. It is unbelievable how they managed to make the noise-cancelling so good. Saves space in my bag, too!

* **Anker USB-C memory card reader**  
Tiny and fast. Takes both SD and micro SD cards.

* **Mophie Powerstation 5000mAh**  
Compact and sleek design. Power input and output via USB-C, with one USB-A port.


### Clothing
Merino wool is the way to go. It is breathable, keeps you warm when it's cold, cools you down when it's hot, and it is odour resistant! 
You can easily wear the same shirt for a week straight. Just let it aerate after each wear. 
You can read more about merino wool on [Packhacker](https://packhacker.com/guide/merino-wool-travel-clothing/). 

* **Lululemon ABC Slim pants**
* **Helly Hansen Loke ‚Äì packable wind breaker**
* **2x Wool And Prince Crew T-shirt**
* **2x Icebreaker Cool-Lite Crew T-shirt**
* **2x Regular T-shirts. Just to mix it up**
* **2x Icebreaker Anatomica boxers**
* **2x Swim shorts**
* **Darn Tough No-Show socks**
* **Billabong flip-flops**
* **Skechers GoWalk 5**

### Personal care
* **Dr Bronner`s soap**  
All purpose vegan soap! Can be used on your entire body, washing clothes or even brushing your teeth!
* **Gillette Styler**  
Small, cheap and runs on one AA battery.
* **Nuud*  
This is a tiny, vegan, super concentrated deodorant that you only have to apply every 2-3 days. If you get another brand, make sure it's not an antiperspirant since it will wear out the merino wool faster.  
* **Bamboo toothbrush**
* **Mini toothpaste**

### Miscellaneous
* **Ticket to the moon(TTTM) hammock with the Lightest straps**  
This takes up some space, but I couldn't leave without this bad boy. Nothing beats chilling in the hammock after a long day of exploring. I am thinking about getting the lightest TTTM hammock, but I will have to try it out first.
* **Eagle creek compression packing cubes**  
A necessity for all travelers. Organize and compress your clothes!
* **Wallet**  
I just use a hairband to hold a debit card and cash together ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  
### Backpack
I currently use the **DB Carry All 40L**. It is certainly not the best backpack ‚Äì lacking a laptop compartment, other smart stuff and comfort, but I like the look of it. Next upgrade(or downgrade) will probably be the expandable Tortuga Setout Divide 26L-34L.

### Conclusion
Do your own thing. This is just what works for me. You will most likely have different needs.
