title: My reflections on working remote in Bali, Canggu

I use the term working remote instead of digital nomad because I did not do much traveling. Canggu was my only destination apart from visiting a few islands where I did zero amount of work.

These thoughts is based on my own preferences and my type of work â€“ programming. Some parts are also only relevant for Swedish people.     

## Why Canggu?
This place has basically everything a remote worker would want. Most places have a solid internet connection, everyone and everything is relaxed and super chill, awesome value for money and most importantly â€“ other like minded people.

## Weather
I spent my two months during january-mars which is at the end of the rain season. When you look at your favorite weather app, it will probably tell you there will be rain and thunder every day. This is not the case. It usually only rains for a few hours during the night. One time it rained back and forth for about 36 hours.

## Accommodation
This always works out for me. I book a hotel for 1-2 weeks through Booking.com to stay at while I find something more long term â€“ usually through various Facebook groups. 

## Transportation
Initially I didn't think I needed a scooter. I mean, I love to walk! Yeah, well. Walking sucks in Canggu ðŸ˜„ There are basically no sidewalks anywhere!

**Get a bike!** The cheapest scooter should be 750 000 IDR. I got the Yamaha Nmax after a month on an old Honda Vario. It's around 1 800 000 IDR for a month. I think it's totally worth it though.

Even though the traffic can be bad at some times. I just love how easy it is to get around.  

## Getting shit done
In a place like Bali, it can be hard to focus with all the amazing distractions everywhere.

### Internet speeds
Overall pretty good. I usually got around 10 Mbit/s in most hotels, homestays and private villas. 
If you rent your own villa â€“ talk to the owner about upgrading the speed!

The fastest 4G SIM card? With out a doubt Telkomsel! I got 15 Mbit/s most of the time. Tried all the big carriers and none came close to Telkomsel. You can get 15GB for 130 000 IDR [here](https://goo.gl/maps/JnSeJ83nrWE2). 

### Co-working
I thought this part was going to be huge for me as a solo traveler. I started with a 50h membership at Dojo. 
After a month the membership expired with 20h left.

The reason was that I could do my work just fine in bed, with AC(Dojo only has two rooms with AC)!   
If I wanted to switch environment I just sat down at one of the gazillion cafes in Canggu. 

### Cafes

## Food
Ommgg yaaaaaas!  
9.5/10 meals have been so good! Everything from smoothie bowls to burgers to pizza!
